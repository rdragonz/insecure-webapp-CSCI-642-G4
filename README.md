# insecure-webapp-CSCI-642-G4
An insecure webapplication generated by an LLM

## Requirements

	java17
	Apache Maven 3.3 or later
	PostgreSQL

## Building

### Create a database

    sudo -u postgres psql
    CREATE DATABASE Calendar;
    CREATE USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE Calendar TO your_username;

Replace "your_username" and "your_password" with your username and password respectively.

Next, create the database schema.

    \connect Calendar
    CREATE TABLE appointments (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        date VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
        time VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
        description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    );
    \q

Finally, edit ``/webapp/src/main/resources/application.properties`` to set the username and password for the PostgreSQL user you just created.

### Running the application

	mvn clean install
	mvn package
	mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.calendar.App"

## Running as a Docker container

This application can be run as a Docker container. The requirements are as follows:

    docker
    docker-compose

copy the .env_sample to .env and add your postgresql credential. If you dont have an existing postgresql credential, you can make up one
and docker will create it for you.

To run the app as a Docker container with SonarQube included, simply run ``docker-compose up``. 

Access to the application will be available at ``http://localhost:8080/my-calendar-app/`` and SonarQube will be available at ``http://localhost:9000``
